This is a project to DIY a pc media controller with Arduino and HC-05 bluetooth module. In the pc side, it uses a python script to receive the commands from the Arduino through bluetooth and control the media player, including previous/next song, pause, and modifying volume. In the Arduino side, it contains some buttons, potentiometer, photoresistor, and HC-05 bluetooth module.
